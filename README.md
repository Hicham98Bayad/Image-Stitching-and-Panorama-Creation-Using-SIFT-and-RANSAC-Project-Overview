# Image Stitching and Panorama Creation Using SIFT and RANSAC
Project Overview:

Developed a robust image stitching system capable of creating seamless panoramas from overlapping images. The project uses advanced computer vision techniques, including feature extraction, keypoint matching, and homography estimation, to align and blend multiple images into a unified panorama. This system demonstrates expertise in image processing, feature-based alignment, and perspective transformation.
Key Features and Workflow:

    Feature Detection and Description:
        Leveraged SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) to detect and describe distinctive keypoints in images, ensuring robustness to scale, rotation, and illumination changes.

    Feature Matching:
        Implemented a Brute-Force Matcher with the Lowe’s ratio test to find reliable correspondences between image keypoints.

    Homography Estimation with RANSAC:
        Used RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) to estimate the transformation matrix, effectively handling outliers and ensuring accurate alignment of overlapping images.

    Image Warping and Stitching:
        Applied the homography matrix to warp images into a shared perspective.
        Seamlessly blended overlapping areas to produce a visually consistent panorama.

    Scalable and Modular Design:
        Designed the system to handle images of varying sizes and resolutions, with easy integration of additional features such as image blending and cropping.

Tools and Technologies:

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, imutils
    Algorithm: SIFT, RANSAC, Homography Estimation
    Visualization: Google Colab for execution and cv2_imshow for displaying intermediate and final results

Challenges Solved:

    Addressed keypoint mismatches by refining the matching process with Lowe’s ratio test.
    Handled varying image resolutions by implementing preprocessing steps to normalize dimensions.
    Ensured robustness against noise and perspective distortions using RANSAC for reliable transformation estimation.

Applications:

    Wide-angle panoramas for photography.
    Image alignment in computer vision pipelines.
    Geographic mapping and aerial photography stitching.
